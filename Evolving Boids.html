            <p>
              Before I get into the details of the project, please look at this
              brief overview of
              <a href="Genetic Algorithm.html">Genetic Algorithm</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Having experimented with genetic algorithms, I wanted to apply
              them to the Renyold's flocking simulation. The simulation is a
              simple one, where a group of boids (birds) are trying to reach a
              target. The boids have a few simple rules that they follow:
              <li>They try to stay close to each other (cohesion)</li>
              <li>They try to avoid hitting each other (separation)</li>
              <li>
                They try to match the velocity of the other boids (alignment)
              </li>
              <li>They try to reach the target (seek)</li>
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/Boids Rules.png" alt="" /></p>
            <p>
              Each of these rules has a weight associated with it and are
              applied using 3D vectors. These weights will act as the DNA of the
              boids. The weights will be randomly generated and then the boids
              will be tested. The test score will be finalised by a fitness
              function. The boids with the best fitness will be selected to
              breed. The DNA (weights) of the boids will be crossed over and
              mutated to create the next generation of boids. This process will
              be repeated until the boids stop dying off due to collisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The crossover and mutation functions are similar to those
              described in the genetic algorithm project. The boids themselves
              have collision avoidance steering, alignment steering, cohesion
              steering and separation steering. The flight path of each boid
              addes all the steering vectors together to get a final steering
              vector.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fitness score is lowered everytime a boid collides with
              another boid and dies off. Now this should have wroked perfectly
              but in genetic algortims there are alwasy nuances that are
              realised later in the code. In this case simply have a negative
              fitness for the boids will make them evolve into a group of boids
              that will never collide... Effectively making them NOT boids. This
              is because the boids will always try to avoid each other which can
              be done by having high seperation weight. The solution to this is
              to have positive feedback/fitness based on the number of
              neighbours a boid has and extra fitness for successfully reaching
              the target threshold. This will make the boids evolve to a point
              where they will evade other boids but also stay as a group. This
              is the final result of the simulation.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              I have hard coded the strength values for all the vectors as they
              were after the evolution to show the final result.
